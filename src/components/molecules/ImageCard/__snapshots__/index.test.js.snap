      I recently began this project as a means of self-development. With the goal of increasing my breadth of knowledge in the world of Software Development, I have created a Notion document containing some important topics that I believe will be helpful to learn for any Full Stack Engineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each topic has a variety of sub-topics/key areas to go into more detail with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The development of this resource has been both for my own learning, and for me to congregate the knowledge I already have. Thus, some content has been written by me directly, and some has been with the assistance of ChatGPT, and then reviewed before addition.
